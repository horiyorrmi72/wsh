                    Abuse is any harmful act directed at an individual based on their biological
                    sex or gender identity. Abuse is commonly referred to as gender-based violence (GBV) and is rooted
                    in gender inequality, the abuse of power and
                    harmful norms. Both males and females can be victims of abuse but the majority of victims are women
                    and girls
